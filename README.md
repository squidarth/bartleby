## Bartleby

### Installation

In order to use Bartleby, you need to have Redis installed and running.  View
http://redis.io/ for more information about how to install it.

Since it is written in Node.js, Node.js and NPM must both be installed.
These can be downloaded at http://nodejs.org/download/.

Bartleby can then be installed with the command
`npm install bartleby -g`

To check that the Bartleby installation was successful, try running:

`bartleby` to start the Bartleby server.

Navigate to `localhost:3700` to view the site.

### Client Libraries

You also need to install a client library for your language in order to use this.
These are currently a WIP, but should be out soon.  If you'd like to immediately
add this to your Ruby on Rails app, take a look at [Bartleby-Rails](http://github.com/squidarth/bartleby-rails)

We currently have libraries written in Python and Ruby, along with some examples.
